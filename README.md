# URank
### College Ranking App

This app is designed to make the college searching process easier.  It has spaces to save all notes pertaining to each college that you add.  You are also able to rank each college on how each specific element of that colllege works for you.  Then, if you also set how important that element is to you in settings, the app will automatically calculate a rating for the college and, therefore, make it easier to select a college for you.

To install this app simply use the app store on your device.  Currently this app is only available on the Play Store, but it will be on the App Store soon.

If you have issues with the app or find bugs please feel free to open an issue here on GitHub.

If you want to modify this code for your own personal use, feel free to do so, but do not release any commercial or public varients of modified code of this app without permission.

## FAQ
**Q:** What do you mean Original Group Members?

**A:** This app was originally developed for the Congressional App Challenge, primarily by **Zander**, in a group with the rest of the original group members.  After we had finished the App Challenge, the app had potential, so **Zander** started over and redesigned the app to contain more features and run better.


**Q:** How do I use this app?

**A:** Look just above this and it explains how to use this app.  If that is confusing, join the community Discord server above.


**Q:** I found a similar app on GitHub that hasn't been updated in a long time and looks similar to this app, what's the deal with that?

**A:** That is the GitHub repository that was used by the original group during the Congressional App Challenge to develop this app, if you look at previous version of this you will see that the one of the first commits is called "Transferred files from old copy", this is referencing code and files that were copied over from the original development.

## Contact
The best way to contact **Zander** is probably via Discord.
